## Overview

<a href="#">Logseq for macOS</a> is designed for people who think in outlines and prefer linking ideas over filing them into rigid folders. Notes are composed of blocks that can be collapsed, reordered and referenced across pages, turning daily logs into a network of related ideas. This block-first structure makes it easy to zoom from big-picture views down to specific details without losing context. Tasks, tags and properties can be embedded wherever work actually happens, rather than being kept in separate lists.

Backlinks, page references and <a href="#">graph overviews</a> reveal how concepts connect over time. Daily journals encourage steady capture of thoughts, while project pages collect plans, meeting notes and research fragments in one evolving space. Because content is stored in plain text or Markdown, it stays portable and versionable. Integrations and plugins extend Logseq into areas like spaced repetition, publishing and advanced querying, letting power users shape the environment around their workflows.

On macOS, Logseq supports keyboard-driven navigation, multiple windows and themes that suit long writing sessions. It fits naturally alongside browsers, terminals and coding tools, becoming the quiet background where knowledge accumulates. Over time, it often grows into both a productivity system and a thinking companion.
